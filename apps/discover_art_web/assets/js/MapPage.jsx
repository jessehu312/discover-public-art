The former salt marsh next to the Ironworkerâ€™s Memorial Bridge early on had a swimming pool that was filled by the tide. When the waters became polluted by industry, a new pool was built. Waterfowl adapted and settled in the pool through the winter months. Now there is an initiative to turn the edge back into a salt marsh. The film contemplates the site as a pivotal place of contestation between the natural and industrial forces of the coastal city."
